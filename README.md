Endless-Tunnel-Rendering-OpenGLES
=================================

A small project to render an Endless tunnel in OpenGLES 1.1

It uses a procedurally generated spinning Torus with a camera inside it to give an illusion of an endless tunnel. Written with portability in mind. Had ported this to iPhone later.

The source code was written back in 2010 using SDL and OpenGL. Used Visual Studio on Windows XP. I have committed the SDL binaries, headers, and the necessary DLL files along too just in case.
